# Netflix-Front-end-Clone

This project is a front-end clone of Netflix, one of the world's leading entertainment services, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to replicate the user interface and experience of Netflix as closely as possible, providing a practical application of front-end web development skills.

The application features a responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across various device sizes. It showcases multiple rows of movie categories, similar to Netflix's layout, each populated with movie posters. When a user hovers over a movie poster, a brief description and other details of the movie are displayed, enhancing the user interaction.

One of the key aspects of this project is the integration with The Movie Database (TMDB) API. This API is used to fetch a vast database of movies, providing the application with up-to-date information about a wide range of movies across various genres. This integration demonstrates the ability to work with external APIs and handle JSON responses effectively.

This Netflix clone is a demonstration of modern web development practices and serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to expand their skills in front-end development or understand the workings of a streaming service interface.
